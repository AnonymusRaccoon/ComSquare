Com² is a SNES emulator for Linux built in C++ by 3 friends.

***

## Installation

You can use an artifact from latest commit by selecting ✔️ and ``Build commit artifact``. You will have an option, if the commit is correct, to download the artifact which you have to unzip.


Overwhise, you can build yourself the program by cloning the repository : ``git clone https://github.com/AnonymusRaccoon/ComSquare.git``

You need the [SDL library](https://www.libsdl.org/).

After going inside the repository directory, create a build folder ``mkdir build``, go inside and make ``cmake ..`` to finally make ``make``. If you've done nothing wrong, you should have the program compiled!


## Informations

During the development we will update and create documentations about the SNES and the emulator, we will use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/AnonymusRaccoon/ComSquare/projects) page and [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/AnonymusRaccoon/ComSquare/wiki) to inform you about "everything".

### Licence

As seen on the badge, we use [GPLv3 license](./LICENSE), so you're free to use, fork and modify our program freely, we are 100% Open Source!
